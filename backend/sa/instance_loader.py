Instance Loader for Simulated Annealing (SA)

This module defines the data structures (Customer, Vehicle, Instance) used by
the SA algorithm. These classes encapsulate the problem data and provide
methods for solution construction and manipulation.

Key Classes:
- Customer: Represents a customer location with demand and time window
- Vehicle: Represents a vehicle that can serve customers along a route
- Instance: Represents the complete problem with multiple vehicles and customers

        1. Uses vehicles one by one
